## Why?

Nominal tweaks discord in way to stay close to the original, be quickly adaptive to changes and mainly improve the design at least a little bit.

It's basically simple eye-candy for an ugly app.

## Features

- Nitro Colour Theme friendly
- Cute accent colours for checkboxes and selections
- AMOLED-like Dark theme & various improvements
- Removes most Nitro promos, useless stuff and hides welcome stickers
- Blurred context menus and backdrops
